      "value": "The Zendesk Support Answer Suggestion app analyzes your ticket subject and looks through your Help Center content to suggest relevant articles and surface them right next to the ticket. Your agents won't get caught not knowing an answer to a customer's question if the answer is in your Help Center.\n\nYour agents can click any of the suggested articles to view them. A quick drag-and-drop enables them to add the article to their ticket response. With the Answer Suggestion app, your agents can answer customer questions faster and more accurately.\n\nFor any questions, please email [support@zendesk.com](mailto:support@zendesk.com).\n\nBy enabling this app, You agree to the [Built by Zendesk Terms of Use](https://www.zendesk.com/company/built-by-zendesk-agmt/)."
